# EaaS
Encryption as a Service -- Python cryptoservice for the IEEE 2015-2016 First Fest finals.

## Running
### Server:
* `python server.py`

### Client:
* Testing: `nc localhost 9999`
* Final run: `nc <ip> <port>` -- change port in file as well.

## To Do
* Explain existing ciphers and cryptoschemes.
* Implement existing ciphers and cryptoschemes.
* Add new algorithms; make sure you can explain them well. ;)
* [if needed] Move ciphers to separate files to modularize code. Currently I've implemented them via a class.
